# KinkyTools - Time Changer

A simple tool that adds 2 hours to your system clock when the bound key combination is pushed.
Perfect for games that base off of system clock - such as Fallout Shelter, Stardew Valley etc.

#### The program was tested, but several issues might occur with web browser and possibly some other software - in which case, just set your system time back to normal.
### Use at your own risk - I do not take responsibility for any damages that may happen.
